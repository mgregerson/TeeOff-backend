# TeeOff-Backend

Welcome to TeeOff, an API designed for golf enthusiasts everywhere!

Welcome to the TeeOff backend repository! This repository contains the necessary files for the backend of the TeeOff Express App.
This backend provides routes for users, holes, and courses, and utilizes a PostgreSQL (psql) database. 

## Usage

The TeeOff backend provides the following routes:

1. Users: Route for managing user-related operations.
2. Holes: Route for managing hole-related operations.

You can interact with these routes by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.
